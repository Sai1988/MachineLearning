In this project i'm considering Boston Housing market as a case study.\
We are using few basic machine learning concepts to predict the best selling price for a home.\

I'm using Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas.

My task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. 
This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for the homes.
