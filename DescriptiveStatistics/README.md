In this project, i will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
I will create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task.
I will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. 
Finally, I will interpret my results in terms of your hypotheses.
